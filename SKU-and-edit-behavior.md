# SKU auto-generation and Edit-on-Blur — Implementation Notes

## Short title
SKU auto-generation (SKU-###) + Fix category-rule upsert + prep for edit-on-blur UX

## Summary of modifications
- Added DB migration file to create `sku_seq` and set a `products.sku` default.
- Modified server-side product creation to return a final, DB-safe SKU to the client.
- Fixed `upsertCategoryRule` to avoid `No values to set` when only `category` is provided.
- Added small utility scripts used during verification (dbStatus, debugSku, countTables, testSkuGeneration, perfTest).

## Files added or edited (explicit)
- Added file: `drizzle/0004_sku_auto_generation.sql`
  - Creates a Postgres sequence `sku_seq` and sets the default for `products.sku` to `SKU-XXX`.

- Edited file: `src/server/actions/productMutations.ts`
  - In `createProduct`: when the incoming product SKU is missing or a placeholder (`NEW-xxx`), the server reads the next value from `sku_seq`, composes `SKU-XXX`, uses it for the insert, and returns the fully-populated product to the client.
  - If the client provides a specific SKU (non-placeholder) it is used as-is.

- Edited file: `src/server/actions/categoryRulesMutations.ts`
  - Normalizes optional values to `null` and builds an `updateData` object composed only of provided (non-null) fields. If there are no fields to update, it performs an `INSERT` (or returns existing) without attempting an empty `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, preventing the `No values to set` error.

- Added scripts used for verification (non-production helpers):
  - `scripts/dbStatus.cjs` — lists `public` tables and sequences.
  - `scripts/countTables.cjs` — prints counts for `tiers`, `providers`, `category_rules`, `price_params`, `products`.
  - `scripts/debugSku.cjs` — shows `nextval('sku_seq')` and `information_schema` default for the `sku` column.
  - `scripts/testSkuGeneration.cjs` — manual insertion test to validate SKU generation and cleanup.
  - `scripts/perfTest.cjs` — lightweight SELECT 1 / mutation timing tool used ad-hoc.

## Why each change was made
- `drizzle/0004_sku_auto_generation.sql` — Using a DB sequence is the most reliable way to produce monotonic, collision-safe identifiers under concurrency. It keeps the uniqueness enforcement at DB level and is simple to reason about.

- `productMutations.ts` — The UI previously created temporary SKUs (`NEW-xxx`) and then the DB generated a final SKU. The code path returned the temporary SKU to the UI, so the product drawer didn't open for the real SKU. Fetching nextval on the server ensures the server returns the true SKU immediately so the UI can use it (open drawer, log, etc.).

- `categoryRulesMutations.ts` — Drizzle / Postgres will refuse `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` when the `set` object is empty; this happens when a user creates a rule with only the `category` name. Building `updateData` dynamically avoids sending an empty `set` and prevents the runtime error.

- Utility scripts — Added to help manual verification and debugging during cutover; they are not required in production and can be removed after verification.

## Special notes, warnings, and limitations
- The repository contains a migration runner (`scripts/applyMigrations.cjs`) which applies SQL files in `drizzle/`. In systems where migrations are tracked, ensure the new file `0004_sku_auto_generation.sql` is ordered correctly and won't re-apply previous migrations.
- Implementation uses a hybrid approach:
  - The SQL migration sets a DB-level default for `products.sku` to use `sku_seq`.
  - The server action also reads `nextval('sku_seq')` and constructs `SKU-XXX` to return the exact SKU immediately to the UI. This is intentional (UI needs the SKU) but you may instead prefer to omit the explicit `sku` in the `INSERT` and rely on `DEFAULT` + `RETURNING` to retrieve the generated SKU. Both approaches are valid; choose one policy and keep it consistent.
- No backfill or renaming of existing SKUs was performed. Existing SKUs are left untouched.
- The added helper scripts use `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`. Do not commit secrets.

## Exact order of operations for the Commit Agent (step-by-step)
Run the following steps on the target environment (development or staging) from the project root. Execute each step in order.

1) Ensure you are on the correct branch and have latest changes:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-with-changes>
git pull --ff-only
```

2) Add and commit the changes if not already committed locally (example):

```powershell
git add drizzle/0004_sku_auto_generation.sql
git add src/server/actions/productMutations.ts
git add src/server/actions/categoryRulesMutations.ts
git add scripts/dbStatus.cjs scripts/countTables.cjs scripts/debugSku.cjs scripts/testSkuGeneration.cjs scripts/perfTest.cjs
git commit -m "feat(db): add sku_seq + return generated SKU; fix category rules upsert; add verification scripts"
```

3) Apply the SQL migration. Two safe options:

Option A — Execute SQL directly (recommended if DB already contains objects and you want to avoid reapplying older migration files):

```powershell
node -e "require('dotenv/config'); const fs = require('fs'); const { Client } = require('pg'); (async () => { const sql = fs.readFileSync('drizzle/0004_sku_auto_generation.sql','utf8'); const client = new Client({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }); await client.connect(); try { await client.query(sql); console.log('Migration applied'); } catch(e) { console.error('Migration failed:', e.message); process.exit(1);} finally { await client.end(); } })();"
```

Option B — Use repository runner (if you prefer):

```powershell
npm run db:migrate:sql
```

4) Verify sequence and default column:

```powershell
node scripts/debugSku.cjs
# Expected output: shows a nextval and a column_default containing nextval('sku_seq')
```

5) Restart (or start) development server and run a quick smoke test:

```powershell
npm run dev
# In another terminal
node scripts/testSkuGeneration.cjs
```

6) Verify UI behavior:
  - Create a product from the UI. Confirm the drawer opens for the returned SKU (e.g., `SKU-001`).
  - Create a category rule passing only `category` — confirm no `No values to set` error and the row exists in `category_rules`.

7) Optional: Run light checks:

```powershell
node scripts/countTables.cjs
node scripts/perfTest.cjs
```

## Checklist for the Commit Agent (to tick after applying)
- [ ] `drizzle/0004_sku_auto_generation.sql` is present in repo and committed.
- [ ] Migration applied successfully and `sku_seq` exists.
- [ ] Creating a product via UI or script returns a `SKU-###` and the drawer opens for that SKU.
- [ ] Creating a category rule with only `category` no longer throws `No values to set`.
